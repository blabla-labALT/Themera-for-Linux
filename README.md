## What's Themera?

Themera is a utility created by definite_d (me) to make the creation of custom PySimpleGUI Look and Feel theme code a breeze while allowing for express customization.
 
Now don't have to potentially flunk multiline dicts, study color theory, memorise color codes (like #FFFFFF), mess around with manually typing color codes or set up a vicious cycle from IDE to color picker (although a professional colour picker has its advantages).

You can choose to meticulously pick your colours, or get a usable theme with fewer clicks than the fingers on one hand instead **(if you don't specify a color though, you'll have the options to randomly fill in those colors, fill in with shades of the colors actually specified, or get colors from an image)** then generate your code and have the options of previewing the generated stuff instantly, or copy and paste the generated code for use. That's not all; your theme's readability can be adjusted or the entire theme can be shuffled around (and then adjusted), all at the click of a button.

If you love the generated theme, and you want to jump in and get meticulous, or (re)start the process with your custom theme as a base, you can do that too.

That's not all of its features though. I suggest you check it out yourself. Hint: there's options to generate Light, Dark and Gray-Out versions of your theme all at once too.

Don't forget to check out the Sample Themes generated with it as well! You might find the theme you need in there.

All themes generated with Themera are free to be used as you choose; the LGPL license applies only to Themera itself. Same goes for the Sample Themes too.

## Summary, Other Details...

Well, in summary, it's a swanky theme code generator :smiley:.

It was also built to be a Christmas gift to PySimpleGUI users, and to act as a bigger 'Thank You' to @MikeTheWatchGuy for PySimpleGUI ('bigger' because I've already said 'Thank You' before). The link to PySimpleGUI's GitHub repo is up there in the header section.

It depends on the PySimpleGUI Tkinter version for it's own GUI, thus every theme it sports can be changed by the user. You can choose from Themera's own light and dark mode themes, or any of the default PySimpleGUI themes. Changes take effect after a restart.
