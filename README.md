## What's Themera?

Themera is a theme code generator for PySimpleGUI.

It enables you to create themes based on any of the existing themes that comes built in with PySimpleGUI, edit any custom existing theme based on the dictionary containing its colors, or create a theme from an image.

After editing, simply copy your theme code, ready to use in your project without need for alteration.

It is – of course – built with PySimpleGUI, free and open source under the LGPL v3 license, and comes with a wide range of features from batch color manipulation, to 13 filters that simulate color blindness, auto-contrast, automatic dark and light modes for themes and more.

All themes generated with Themera are free to be used as you choose; the LGPL license applies only to Themera itself. Same goes for the Sample Themes theme code too.
